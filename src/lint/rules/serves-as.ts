// The "Serves As" Dodge (issue #18) — {serve as, stand as, mark, represent} standing in for a
// plain "is"/"are". The word list lives in src/lint/lexicons/serves-as-verbs.ts (imported below,
// never redefined here); this file supplies the STRUCTURE that tells a dodge from a literal use
// of the same verb — the thing a word list alone can't do ("the sign marks the trailhead" uses
// the exact same word as "the plaque marks a turning point").
//
// Two grammatically different frames share the one lexicon:
//
//   PHRASAL — "serve as" / "stand as". SERVE and STAND are intransitive on their own; the dodge's
//   target sits inside an "as X" prepositional phrase hanging off the VERB
//   (clause.verb.modifiers), not the clause's own complement — clause.complement stays null
//   ("The building serves" has no object of its own; "as a reminder" is a PP, not a direct
//   object). Confirming the frame means finding that "as" PP and checking its object is a PLAIN
//   nominal: "The waiter serves as many tables as he can" fails this because the trailing
//   "as he can" leaves its own comparative clause-modifier hanging off the object ("many tables"
//   modified by an "as"-connected clause) — that nested modifier is the structural tell that this
//   is the "as ... as" comparative, not "serve as NOUN", and isPlainNominal below rejects it.
//
//   BARE — "mark" / "represent". These ARE transitive main verbs; the target is the clause's own
//   complement (direct object or predicate noun), read via ir-query's complementHead. Structurally
//   "the sign marks the trailhead" and "the plaque marks a turning point" are IDENTICAL shapes —
//   telling literal from figurative needs semantics (is the complement abstract?) that this rule
//   deliberately does not attempt (lexicons/types.ts's own note calls this exact call a wave-2
//   design decision, not something POS/structure can resolve). So the bare frame is scored lower
//   than the phrasal one and only escalates with repetition — see SEVERITY TIERS below.
//
// SEVERITY TIERS. Both frames start from servesAsVerbs.defaultSeverity ("low") and shift by one
// step along candidate < low < medium < high:
//   - PHRASAL hits get defaultSeverity shifted UP one tier ("full severity", medium) unconditionally
//     — the literal word "as" plus a plain nominal complement is confirming structural evidence a
//     bare transitive verb doesn't have, so a single hit is already trustworthy.
//   - BARE hits get defaultSeverity shifted DOWN one tier ("candidate" — see the Severity type's
//     own doc comment: "structurally-narrowed suspects a rule can't confirm without semantics",
//     which is exactly this case) UNLESS the document repeats the bare pattern at least
//     servesAsVerbs.densityThreshold times, in which case they hold at the lexicon's own
//     defaultSeverity ("low") — repetition is the only corroboration a structural-only check can
//     use for mark/represent, mirroring rules/demo.ts's "count first, judge second".
//
// PARSER GAP — reported per #18's ground rules, NOT fixed here (src/nlp/parse.ts is out of scope
// for this issue): the rule-based chunker currently drops "as X" entirely after serve/stand.
// Verified: parse("The building serves as a reminder of the city's heritage.") returns
// `(S (NP (DT The) (NN building)) (VP (VBZ serves)))` — nothing after "serves" at all, for both
// the dodging and the comparative example alike. So clause.verb.modifiers is always [] for these
// two verbs through today's readDocument, and the phrasal frame — though implemented exactly as
// specified below and pinned against hand-built Clause fixtures in serves-as.test.ts — cannot
// fire end-to-end today; see that file's "parser gap" describe block for the pinned reproduction.
// mark/represent are unaffected: plain transitive objects parse fine today (verified against
// readDocument — "represents a turning point" and "marks a turning point" both lower to an
// ordinary directObject complement, and passive voice, "is represented by ...", correctly leaves
// clause.complement null, which the bare frame's own transitive-frame requirement already handles
// without any special-casing).

// "it WORD that" frame gives it the syntactic context compromise's tagger actually listens to,
// which resolves every inflection this lexicon lists (verified by hand: serves/served/serving/
// serve -> serve; stands/stood -> stand; marks/marking/marked/mark -> mark; represents/
// representing/represented/represent -> represent). ing-tackon.ts carries its own copy of this
