// Factory for the claude-isms lexicon rules (issue #34). Same matching semantics as the generic
// lexical tier (entryHits from lexical.ts: case-folded whole tokens, contiguous phrases, narrow
// lemma suffixes, fail-closed posGate) — but the OPPOSITE severity philosophy, by owner decision
// on #34:
//
//   ONE HIT FIRES, VISIBLY. Claude's dialect has spread widely enough into human prose that a
//   single marker phrase is already the tell. There is NO below-threshold step-down (the generic
//   tier demotes sparse hits toward "candidate"; this tier never does). Density only ESCALATES:
//   when a lexicon declares densityThreshold N and the document reaches N total hits from that
//   lexicon, every hit riding the lexicon's defaultSeverity steps UP one level, capped at "high".
//   Entries with an explicit severity are pinned there in both directions, same as the generic
//   tier.
//
// The claim a finding makes is about the PHRASE, never the author: "this reads as Claude-flavored
// and is worth rewording" — explanations must teach, not accuse (see #34's non-goals).
