// Fragment tier (epic #28, #15) — the fragment-preserving splitter is the whole point: a verbless
// unit ("Not a bug.") is data, not a parse failure (see document.ts and types.ts's UnitOutcome).
// Two rules live here because they share every helper below (short-fragment eligibility, markdown
// suppression, the quote heuristic) and both walk doc.units in document order looking for runs.
//
// Tier: "discourse", not "syntactic". Both rules are fundamentally cross-sentence — punchy-fragments
// measures a document-wide (or run-wide) density and countdown recognizes a shape across 3+ units —
// neither says anything about a single sentence's grammar the way a syntactic rule would.
//
// --- what counts as a fragment here ---
// unit.outcome === "fragment" is the ENTIRE signal: document.ts already decides "verbless" for us
// (no-VP on the tree path, "no-verb:" on the parse-failure path — see document.ts's treeReason and
// readUnit). We do not re-derive verblessness from unit.reason; outcome alone is document.ts's
// considered answer, and unit.reason strings are informal (stub-doc.ts's makeDoc doesn't reproduce
// them at all — see stub-doc.ts). outcome === "unparseable" is a DIFFERENT signal (the parser choked
// on something that does have a predicate, e.g. a "she said" dialogue tag) and is never treated as a
// fragment here, per the issue: "treat parser-fell-over unparseables as NOT fragments."
//
// One consequence, called out in the issue and pinned by document.test.ts ("chunker loses the
// copula"): the rule-based chunker also marks a contracted-copula clause like "It's not bold." as
// "fragment" (it can't see the 's as a verb). We don't special-case that away — instead both rules
// key off the unit's FIRST WORD TOKEN, and "It's" is never "Not"/"No", so the reframe trope ("It's
// not bold — it's backwards.") never satisfies either rule's negation/short-run shape regardless of
// how its outcome got decided.
//
// --- suppression ---
// Two independent filters, applied before a unit is allowed to play ANY role (short fragment,
// negated opener, or countdown cap):
//   markdown   the unit's span sits inside a heading/bullet/codeFence/blockquote line (whole-span
//              containment via markdown.ts's inKind — same idiom rules/formatting.ts uses). A unit
//              from readDocument (document.ts's splitUnits, which does NOT split on newlines) can
//              straddle a heading line and the prose after it when the heading has no terminal
//              punctuation; inKind is strict about whole-span containment, so a straddling unit is
//              NOT suppressed. That's a known gap in the fragment-preserving splitter, not something
//              this rule can fix (document.ts is out of scope for #15) — makeDoc's splitter (which
//              does split on newlines) does not have this problem, which is why the markdown
//              suppression tests below build their fixtures with makeDoc.
//   quotation  dialogue and quoted speech. A "she said" / "he replied" tag on a quoted line usually
//              already saves us for free: hasVerb(unit) sees the verb and document.ts calls the
//              whole unit "unparseable", not "fragment" (see document.ts's readUnit). But bare
//              quoted fragments with no attribution ("Not a bug." "Not a feature.") DO come back
//              verbless. The heuristic: scan the document for quote characters (" " ` and the curly
//              pair), pair them up by simple alternation (odd occurrence opens, even closes) — this
//              is deliberately not a real quote parser, just enough to bound the common case — and
//              suppress a unit whose span overlaps a quoted interval by at least half its own length
//              ("dominated by a quoted span"). A unit fully inside a quoted interval trivially clears
//              that bar, which covers "starts and ends inside quotation marks" too.

// "He published this. Openly. In a book. As a priest." — a lowered opener followed by a run of
// short verbless fragments. Two ways to trip this rule, checked in order per document:
//
//   1. A RUN of >= 2 consecutive eligible short fragments (eligible = outcome "fragment", <= 4
//      words, not suppressed) is direct evidence on its own — "runs...weigh more" from the issue —
//      and fires regardless of how long the rest of the document is. One finding per maximal run,
//      spanning the run; severity "medium" at exactly 2, "high" at 3+.
//   2. Only if NO run fired anywhere in the document: a document-wide density fallback for
//      fragments that never cluster into a run (spread one-per-paragraph, say) but are still
//      frequent enough to be a document-wide tic. Needs >= 2 eligible short fragments total (the
//      absolute floor that keeps one intentional fragment clean) AND a document with >= MIN_UNITS
//      units total (so a two-sentence document can't trip this on density alone) AND density
//      (eligible short fragments / total units) >= 0.3 for "medium", >= 0.5 for "high". One finding
//      spanning the first eligible fragment to the last.
//
// MIN_UNITS only gates the density fallback, not run detection — a run of 2+ short fragments fires
// regardless of how long the surrounding document is (see "He published this..." above, a 4-unit
// document). One consequence: "It's not bold. It's backwards." — both units come back "fragment"
// via the copula-losing bug documented above, both short — DOES form a qualifying run and this rule
// fires on it. That's a legitimate reading under this rule's contract (outcome === "fragment" is
// the signal, full stop; two three-word verbless-per-the-chunker units in a row is exactly what a
// run is), not a bug: the issue's explicit "must not fire on this input" requirement names the
// countdown rule only, because ONLY countdown's shape (negation + cap) is what this specific input
// pretends to be (a reframe, not a countdown). This is documented and tested below rather than
