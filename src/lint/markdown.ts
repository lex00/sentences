// Markdown-aware pre-scan (epic #28, #21). Parser-free: no remark/markdown-it dependency, just
// line-based classification. This is the shared structural context that the formatting tier reads
// directly and that #15/#16's rules will call into for suppression ("don't fire inside a code
// fence", "this negative-parallelism hit is in a heading, downweight it"). Keep the API small and
// stable — two other agents build against it after this lands.
//
// markdownContext(text) is pure: same input, same output, no I/O. It never re-slices doc.text for
// rules — every Span it hands back slices cleanly from the ORIGINAL text passed in.
//
// What counts as what (documented because none of this is a real markdown parser):
//   heading     ATX only: /^ {0,3}#{1,6}(\s|$)/. Setext headings (underlined with ===/---) are not
//               detected — a === or --- line reads as prose. Rare enough in prose docs to skip.
//   bullet      A line starting (after up to 3 leading spaces) with one of the ASCII markers
//               (-, *, +), one of the GLYPH markers (see BULLET_RE), or a decimal number followed
//               by . or ) — in every case followed by whitespace ("- ", "\u2022 ", "1. ", "2) ").
//   codeFence   A line starting (after up to 3 leading spaces) with 3+ backticks or 3+ tildes opens
//               a fence; every line up to and including the matching close (same character, count
//               >= the opener's) is "codeFence", closer included. An unterminated fence runs to the
//               end of the document — better to over-suppress than to lint inside broken fences.
//               Fences do not nest and are not recognized inside another fence.
//   blockquote  A line starting (after up to 3 leading spaces) with '>'.
//   prose       Everything else that isn't blank.
//   (blank)     Whitespace-only lines are not classified at all — they don't appear in `lines`, they
//               only act as separators when grouping paragraphs and lists.
//
// Precedence when a line could match more than one thing: fence state wins first (checked before
// anything else, and while a fence is open every line is "codeFence" regardless of shape), then
// heading, then blockquote, then bullet, then prose. So "> # not a heading" is a blockquote line,
// not a heading — only the leading marker is used to classify.
